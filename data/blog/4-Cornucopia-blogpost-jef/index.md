# Empowering Scrum Teams with OWASP Cornucopia for Enhanced Software Security
This is the first post in a series on how Cornucopia can concretely assist Scrum teams.
 
In today's fast-paced agile software development environment, security considerations may inadvertently take a back seat. However, OWASP Cornucopia turns the tables by embedding security into the very fabric of the development lifecycle.
 
## 1. Reimagining Product Planning 
Product planning and grooming sessions are transformed with Cornucopia. This game sparks collaborative discussions on cybersecurity threats, making complex security concepts accessible and engaging for the entire development team and stakeholders. The outcome? A curated list of pertinent security threats tailored to your application.
 
## 2. Strategic Threat Prioritization
With a clear list of threats from Cornucopia, prioritizing them within the product backlog is crucial.
Cornucopia's intuitive card hierarchy (where higher-ranked cards indicate higher risks) guides this process.
The game's inherent ranking system assists in identifying the most critical threats to address, providing a clear direction for the integration of the threaths within the Product Backlog.
 
## 3. Comprehensive Threat Modeling 
The subsequent phase involves a deep dive into threat modeling, where you validate and analyze each potential threat. Cornucopia facilitates this by providing CAPEC-IDs for each card, which helps in exploring the nature of threats and their possible mitigations. This step consolidates threat modeling into one streamlined process, offering a clear pathway from threat identification to mitigation strategy development.  Our website provides further support for the analysis of the threats by providing cheatsheets where you gain access to a wealth of technical deep-dives into relevant security related development-topics.
 
## Conclusion
Integrating Cornucopia into your Scrum workflow transforms security from a static checklist into a dynamic, sprint-by-sprint endeavor. It fosters a culture of proactive security, ensuring that safeguards evolve in tandem with your software's development.
